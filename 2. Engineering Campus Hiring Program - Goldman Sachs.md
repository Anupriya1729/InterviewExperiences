Interview - 3 Rounds 

All Rounds were conducted on the same day virtually.
(Received mail 3 days before interview)

Round 1 - 
Zoom call
Introduce yourself
Tell me about your project- some cross questions
Then I was asked to click on the codepair link (HackerRank Codepair Feature)
Tell me about Trees
Problem given - LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
Gave 2 approaches, Edge cases, Explanation
Started from Brute force then optimized it.
I forgot to tell about my assumption that I was assuming the keys to be present in the tree.
I was knowing the concept but missed out conveying it to the interviewer.
Later she pointed this out.
After this round, many people were eliminated.


Suggestions- 
Cross question the interviewer before you start coding
Start from brute force
An optimized solution is not everything, you need to have a very clear thought process which is something that you can't develop in 1 day.
Communicating your thoughts efficiently is the KEY point in Goldman Sachs interviews.
Keep track of all the edge cases, don't give the interviewer the chance to point out bugs in your code.
Communicate all the points. Tell them about your assumptions (if any)

Things to prepare-
1. DSA (most imp) as they are interested in testing your problem-solving skills.
2. Puzzles
3. Practice communicating while you code. 
4. About your projects, Intro, Questions to ask from the interviewer
5. They are not concerned much about the theoritical part but still keep yourself prepared with the basics.
6. Know your RESUME
