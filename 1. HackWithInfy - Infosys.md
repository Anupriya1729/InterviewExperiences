Few Coding Questions that I remember. (Note - these are not the exact problem statements)

Round 1
1. Babushka Dolls
	You are given a number 'n' and the next 'n' lines represent sizes of 'n' dolls. 
  You have to tell how many Babushkas you can make.
	A Babushka doll is a set of 3 dolls placed inside another. 
	Example - 
	7
	1 2 5 4 3 6 7
	O/P - 2
	Explanation : 1 2 3 can be one set, 4 5 6 can be another
	I'll share the solution later.

2. Dynamic Programming related
	It was basically the extended version of a problem on InterviewBit.

Round 2
1. Minimize the sum
2. Very good modification of the standard coding question called LIS - 
Longest Increasing Subsequence (level - Hard), Programming Paradigm - Dynamic Programming

I solved 2 in round 1 and 2 in round2 also tried to attempt the 3rd one.
Got interview opportunity for SES profile.

The interview was not much hectic as the interviewer saw some decent projects and internships in my resume. 
Was asked to code 2 easy problems one of them was Merge Sort. Then some discussion about my achievements.
Note- The interviewer will read your entire resume so make sure you enter only valid details. 

But this was not the case with the other batchmates who appeared for the interview. So, it varies from person to person.

Got offer for SES profile.

Topics to prepare:
1. Everything that you have mentioned in your resume
2. DBMS (most imp)
3. OOP and Software Engineering que like - SDLC, AGILE, Waterfall etc.
4. OS CN basics but if you have already mentioned in your resume then prepare in-depth
5. Some basic System Design questions like how will you design an E-com website
6. Prepare your intro, project explanation, questions to ask from the interviewer
7. Just revise the basic coding that you did for clearing previous rounds.

Useful resources as recommended by really good coders who are placed. I've also tried these personally and it worked for me.
1. Leetcode - during preparation
2. Codeforces - solve at least A B C
3. Interview Bit when interviews are near like 2 3 months before you can start because it has only selected questions.
4. pramp.com for giving mock interviews
